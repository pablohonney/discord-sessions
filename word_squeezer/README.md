# Word Squeezer

Word squeezer (слововыжималка) is a game of finding new words from character subsets of a long source word.

For example the word 'morning' will produce the words 'groin mignon minor morin', of length 5 letters or more, excluding 'morning' itself. 

On a Mac system the command would be `python squeeze.py -f /usr/share/dict/words morning -l 5`
